Problem Statement:
Inner-city congestion remains a growing problem in todayâ€™s technological society and we need a cost-effective, ethical, and social solution.

The application will provide users with an incentive to use public transport and allow them to collaborate socially with other commuters and add friends1. It will also inform users of the impact they are having on the environment2 and allow them to redeem gift cards and free ride vouchers with points they earned by using public transport3.
